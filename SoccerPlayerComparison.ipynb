    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project started as a simple tool to scrape soccer player statistics from the WhoScored website. The initial goal was to gather performance data for a single player, focusing on key stats like goals, assists, and appearances. Using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, I built a script that navigates the website, extracts the relevant data, and organizes it into a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully scraping data for one player, I expanded the project to compare stats between two different players. The enhanced script now pulls data for both players, allowing for a side-by-side comparison of their performances. This includes calculating total goals, assists, and goal-to-game ratios, helping to determine which player has the edge in various categories."
