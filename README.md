# Soccer-Player-Web-Scraping
This project scrapes soccer player stats from WhoScored, initially focusing on one player. It was then expanded to compare two players, analyzing key metrics like goals, assists, and appearances. Using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, the tool automates data collection and enables side-by-side performance comparisons.
